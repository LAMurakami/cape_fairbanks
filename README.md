## GitLab and GitHub public Projects/Repositories
The
[gitlab.com/aws-lam/cape_fairbanks](https://gitlab.com/aws-lam/cape_fairbanks)
Project is a clone of the
[github.com/LAMurakami/cape_fairbanks](https://github.com/LAMurakami/cape_fairbanks)
Repostory.  My
[gitlab.com/LAMurakami](https://gitlab.com/LAMurakami)
account was created so that Projects can be cloned using https without
authentication over IPv6 as well as IPv4 unlike the
[github.com/LAMurakami](https://github.com/LAMurakami)
Repostories that can only be accessed over IPv6 with the
[IPv6 only workaround.](https://lamurakami.github.io/blog/2024/06/05/Access-GitHub-com-from-an-instance-without
-a-public-IPv4-address.html)
